# Machine-Learning-in-Growth-and-Form
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to reaction-diffusion equations, with a focus on simulating growth and form in biological systems. Currently, it includes a 2D reaction-diffusion simulation and a 3D diffusion test using libigl.
Project Overview
1. 2D Reaction-Diffusion Simulation
We have implemented a 2D reaction-diffusion simulation using Python and JAX. The simulation is based on the following equations:

Key features of the 2D simulation:

Initialization of a 2D grid with specific initial conditions
Implementation of the above reaction-diffusion equations
Parameter optimization using machine learning techniques
Visualization of results, including initial state, final state, and target shapes

2. 3D Diffusion Simulation Test
As a preliminary step towards a full 3D reaction-diffusion system, we have implemented a basic 3D diffusion simulation using libigl. This demonstrates our ability to work with 3D geometries and sets the stage for more complex 3D simulations in the future.
Results
After running the 2D simulation, you should see output similar to the image below, showing the dynamics of U1 at the center point, initial and final shapes, and target shapes:
